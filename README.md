# Restaurant

- Search
  - Lazy Query for not running immidetley

# Testing

- Focusing the output not a implemetation
- setting the jest
- "jest":{
  "collectCoverageFrom": [
  "./src/components/**/*.tsx",
  "./src/pages/**/*.tsx",
  "./src/routers/**/*.tsx"
  ]
  }

- Check the script to coverage

  - "test:cov" : "npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false"

- ## Component Testing

  - ### App Testing

    - mocking each Components
    - testing by screen.getText "expected user output"

  - ### Btn Testing

    - Not care about ternary opertation
    - expected with to have Class "" testing !!

  - ### RestaurantList

    - props just make a object for props and use seperate operations
    - screen.getByRole("things)

  - ### Header

    - getByText, queryByText return different, fail and null
    - mocking Query me
      - Using MockedProvider apollo offering
      -
      ```
      mocks={[
        {
        request: {
        query: ME_QUERY,
        },
        result: {
        data: {
        me: {
        id: 1,
        email: "",
        role: "",
        verified: true,
        },
        },
        },
        },
        ]}
      ```
      - can give a mock value exactly same on query

  - ### Pagination

    - Mocking state like this
    - const my = 2;
    - const setPage = jest.fn();
    - React.useState = jest.fn().mockReturnValue([my, setPage]);

  - ### CategoryList
    - Nothing special use varialbes and get text the test name

- ## Page Testing

    - Need to testing variables of mutations but apollo mockprovider can't test like that, It's not giving enough detail contorll for unit testing

    - Login input "userEvent type, clear click ,etc.. make real events"
    - Don't forget it's not going to db

  - ### Create
